Alyssa, Caitlyn & Shawn

Progress:
- determined functional QR code side - fairly large but will be used to test additional functionality

PDF Reader class:
- will read all the pages of a PDF document
- will be responsible for identifying all read QR codes and interpreting: the exam id, exam version (ordering) id, the question number, and the answer number, and software generation version info
- classes will be generated that will create and identify those necessary elements of the qr code
- organization of the string's QR code will be the following format:
	v#####e#####s#####q###a## where e precedes the exam id, s precedes the student id (or ordering number), q precedes the question number, a precedes the answer number and v precedes the software version and all numerics are not fixed length
- Alyssa will do

Shawn:
- will create process flow model for all essentially mapped functions to show how everything will interact at a basic level

Caitlyn:
- will continue to work on integrating questions being read from the database
